REGN
====

Robust Estimation of Global Precipitation using Neural Networks (REGN) is a
research project investigating how quantile regression neural networks (`QRNNs
<https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/11/4627/2018/>`_) can be used to yield more
reliable and potentially more accurate precipitation estimates from the
satellite observations of the Global Precipitation Measurement (`GPM
<https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/main/index.html>`_).
