Data
====

We currently have two different datasets to work with: The GMI dataset and the
MHS dataset. The GMI dataset consists of co-located observations from the
Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (`DPR
<https://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM/flight-project/DPR>`_) and the GPM Microwave Imager
(`GMI <https://pmm.nasa.gov/gpm/flight-project/gmi>`_) both flown on the GPM
Core Observatory satellite. The MHS dataset consists of simulated observations
from the Microwave humidity sounder (`MHS <https://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/mhs/>`_)
onboard the MetOp-A satellites based on DPR measurements.
