Getting started
===============

Required packages
-----------------

Typhon
^^^^^^

The :code:`typhon` package provides an implementation
of QRNNs. Since the work we are doing here will likely
depend on new features added to typhon, you have to
install the development version.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/atmtools/typhon
   cd typhon
   pip install -e .


Pytorch
^^^^^^^

The :code:`pytorch` deep-learning package is used as a backend
for neural network. To install it, simply follow the instruction
on `pytorch.org https://pytorch.org/`.
